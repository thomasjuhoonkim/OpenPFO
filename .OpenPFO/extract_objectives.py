    The extract_objectives function is used to rank simulation results in a
    multi-objective optimization case.

    The extract_objectives MUST process OpenFOAM results for each grid point in
    the design space using a post-processor of your choice.

    Optionally, you can add side effects to your optimization such as image
    extractation and data analysis using inputs/extract_assets.py

    NOTE: This function MUST return a list of objectives to MINIMIZE for. Use the provided `objectives` list.
